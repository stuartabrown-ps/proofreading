![Jane Doe](images/stuartabrownprofile.jpg)

I completed my PhD in European Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde in 2012. Following my doctoral studies, I joined the London School of Economics as an academic editor and I now work full-time as the Managing Editor of LSE's [EUROPP - European Politics and Policy blog](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/). I've provided editorial assistance on a freelance basis to a large number of academics. I also previously worked on a major project with the European Court of Auditors to help improve the readability of the Court's Special Reports.

Alongside my editorial work, I have an active research career. I published a book with Palgrave Macmillan on the European Commission in 2016 and I've authored several papers in peer-reviewed journals, including European Political Science, the Journal of European Integration and the Journal of Scholarly Publishing. I was recently awarded the [Jacqui Briggs EPS prize](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/journal/41304/about/jacqui-briggs-eps-prize) by the European Consortium for Political Research in relation to an article I published on the UK's EU referendum.

While I currently live in London, I spent four years studying Japanese in Japan and I hold a Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) certificate at the N1 level. I would be happy to translate academic work from Japanese to English. Please note that I only offer services related to academic work and I do not provide translations of official documents (e.g. for visa applications).
