I can be flexible to suit your requirements, but I generally offer two categories of service. 

---

## Proofreading

If you select this service, I will read through your text, correct all errors, and improve the flow if necessary. I usually work in Microsoft Office and insert amendments using track changes, but I can also include changes as comments if your document is a PDF file.

---

## Comprehensive editing

My comprehensive editing service goes further than simply correcting errors. I will rewrite and potentially restructure your text to ensure it looks as professional as possible. This service is suitable if you lack experience writing academic papers in English and would like your work to be extensively redrafted.

## Pricing

As a guide price, for a 7,000 word journal article, I usually offer proofreading at £150 and comprehensive editing at £250. I accept payment by PayPal and bank transfer.
